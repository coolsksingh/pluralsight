    <h3>Creation</h3>

    <p>I'm a high-tech robot; I was built in 2997 at Mom's Robot Factory as Bending Unit 22 (serial number 2716057) in
        Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. I was
        created specifically for the relatively simple task of bending straight metal girders to various angles.</p>
    <hr>

    <h3>Design</h3>

    <p>My design is based on an original "gas-blasting" prototype developed <strong><em>by <abbr
            title="Professor Farnsworth. He is a crazy scientist, CEO and owner of Planet Express delivery company, professor at Mars University and my boss.">PF</abbr></em></strong>.
    </p>

    <p>My factory-set height is 5 ft 6 in (1.68 m); a little over 6 ft (1.8 m) with antenna.</p>

    <p>I have a body with a "shiny metal ass", two legs, two arms with three fingers each, a head with two replaceable
        eyes shaped like light-emitting diodes,
        a mouth used for fuel intake and voice communication, and a nose, but I choose not to wear it. My head has a
        data socket and remotely operated volume control. My body has a socket for a microphone jack, a dual-socket
        power
        receptacle, a reset button, a kill switch, and a self-destruct button.</p>

    <p>Unlike other robots, I'm mortal and, according to PF's calculations, may have less than one billion years to
        live.
        Because of a manufacturing error that left me without a backup unit, my memory can't be transferred to another
        robot.</p>
    <hr>

    <h3>Composition</h3>

    <p> I'm made of 40% <acronym title="Zinc"><em>Zn</em></acronym>, 40% <acronym title="Titanium"><em>Ti</em></acronym>,
        30% <acronym title="Iron"><em>Fe</em></acronym>,
        40% <acronym title="Dolomite"><em>CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub></em></acronym>, 40% <acronym
                title="Lead"><em>Pb</em></acronym>, 40% Luck/horseshoes,
        40% <acronym title="Chromium"><em>Cr</em></acronym>, 60% Storage space, 40% Scrap metal, 40% Wire, 40% Empty,
        and 40% Ass.</p>
    <hr>

    <h3>Sourse of energy</h3>

    <p>I operate on alcohol-based fuel, which is converted into electrical energy strong enough to power not only
        myself,
        but also small household appliances plugged into his power receptacle. When I stop drinking and begin to sober
        (in human terms),
        I become increasingly drunk-like and dysfunctional, and I grow a red beard of rust.
        I also have a nuclear reactor. However its location inside my body and purpose aren't specified.</p>
    <hr>

    <h3>Functions</h3>

    <p>My human-like character is also reinforced by my ability to display many traits like a whistling, snoring, having
        bloodshot eyes,
        crying, feeling at the least physical attraction, being tickled, dreaming, and belching.</p>

    <p>As a bending unit, I bend straight metal girders to various angles.</p>

    <p>I'm extremely durable and strong, as I'm able to break through solid objects, survive gunfire and explosions,
        function
        underwater or in the vacuum of space, and sustain extremely high temperatures.</p>

    <p>I disassemble and reassemble my body at will and operate each detached body part individually and remotely,
        by using my transmitter and antenna to send wireless signals.</p>

    <p>I use my chest cavity as a locker, which seems to store much more than is physically possible.</p>

    <p>My body's incredibly adaptive depending on the situation at hand; and I can produce needed objects at will,
        finding them stored in my main body cavity.</p>

    <p>I have a computer in my head with data storage with capacity in excess of 50 TB; I can perform calculations, but
        I'm a poor calculator.</p>

<h2><span>M</span>ission</h2>

<div>
    <p>My intention is jesting taboos, drinking, smoking, stealing, swearing, sitting back, watching TV, partying in
        clubs with robowomen, and <strong>killing all the people</strong>.</p>

    <p>The main principle of my life: <q>Everything in life can be solved by
        bending</q>.</p>
</div>

<h2><span>E</span>ducation </h2>

<div>
    <p>I was programmed for cold-bending structural steel and later attended Bending State University, where I majored
        in bending and minored in Robo-American Studies.</p>
</div>

<h2><span>C</span>areer history </h2>
<pre>
	I had a first job at the <strong
        title="The factory of bending steel girders for the construction of suicide booths."><em>Metalworking
    factory</em></strong> as the bending robot.
	I currently work at the <strong title="Professor Farnsworth's courier delivery service."><em>Planet
    Express</em></strong> as the assistant manager of sales.

<h2><span>S</span>kills </h2>

<div>
    <p>- I can think and communicate, when my body's seemingly destroyed or completely detached from my head.</p>

    <p>- I can use my chest as a boil kettle, hopback and fermentation tank to produce home-made beer; to store heads in
        jars, small children, alcohol, money,
        loot, the world's last darkroom.</p>

    <p>- I constantly steal, ranging from the petty theft of wallets to much higher crimes like kidnapping Jay Leno's
        head and stealing <strong title="Philip J. Fry; he's my best friend.">Fry</strong>'s blood.</p>

    <p>- I'm fascinated with cooking, I'm the Planet Express ship's chef.</p>

    <p>- I can fly.</p>

    <p>- I sing folk songs.</p>

    <p>- I can be a robowoman.</p>

    <p>- Saved all robots from destroying the Earth by President Nixon.</p>

    <p>- Filmed in the Calculon's serial "All my details".</p>

    <p>- Fought vs. the race balls.</p>

    <p>- Can play the bahjo and the piano.</p>

    <p>- Gathered a million subscribers on Twitter.</p>

    <p>- Was the God; on my body lived little men.</p>
