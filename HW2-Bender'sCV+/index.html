    <dl>
        <dt> Creation</dt>
        <dd>I'm a high-tech robot; I was built in 2997 at Mom's Robot Factory as Bending Unit 22 (serial number 2716057)
            in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. I was created specifically for the relatively simple task of bending
            straight metal girders to various angles.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <hr>
    <dl>
        <dt>Design</dt>
        <dd>My design is based on an original "gas-blasting" prototype developed <strong><em>by <abbr
                title="Professor Farnsworth. He is a crazy scientist, CEO and owner of Planet Express delivery company, professor at Mars University and my boss."><a
                href="http://theinfosphere.org/Professor_Hubert_J._Farnsworth">PF</a></abbr></em></strong>.
        </dd>
        <dd>My factory-set height is 5 ft 6 in (1.68 m); a little over 6 ft (1.8 m) with antenna.</dd>
        <dd>I have a body with a "shiny metal ass", two legs, two arms with three fingers each, a head with two
            replaceable eyes shaped like light-emitting diodes, a mouth used for fuel intake and voice communication,
            and a nose, but I choose not to wear it. My head has a data socket and remotely operated volume control. My
            body has a socket for a microphone jack, a dual-socket power receptacle, a reset button, a kill switch, and
            a self-destruct button.
        </dd>
        <dd>My head contains a 6502 Microprocessor, and my ass an Athlon II.</dd>
        <dd>Unlike other robots, I'm mortal and, according to PF's calculations, may have less than one billion years to
            live. Because of a manufacturing error that left me without a backup unit, my memory can't be transferred to
            another robot.

        <dt>Sourse of energy</dt>
        <dd>I operate on alcohol-based fuel, which is converted into electrical energy strong enough to power not only
            myself, but also small household appliances plugged into his power receptacle. When I stop drinking and
            begin to sober (in human terms),
            I become increasingly drunk-like and dysfunctional, and I grow a red beard of rust.
            I also have a nuclear reactor. However its location inside my body and purpose aren't specified.

        <dt>Functions</dt>
        <dd>
            <ul>
                <li>My human-like character is also reinforced by my ability to display many traits like a whistling,
                    snoring, having bloodshot eyes, crying, feeling at the least physical attraction, being tickled,
                    dreaming, and belching.
                </li>
                <li>As a bending unit, I bend straight metal girders to various angles.</li>
                <li>I'm extremely durable and strong, as I'm able to break through solid objects, survive gunfire and
                    explosions, function underwater or in the vacuum of space, and sustain extremely high temperatures.
                </li>
                <li>I disassemble and reassemble my body at will and operate each detached body part individually and
                    remotely, by using my transmitter and antenna to send wireless signals.
                </li>
                <li>I use my chest cavity as a locker, which seems to store much more than is physically possible.</li>
                <li>My body's incredibly adaptive depending on the situation at hand; and I can produce needed objects
                    at will, finding them stored in my main body cavity.
                </li>
                <li>I have a computer in my head with data storage with capacity in excess of 50 TB; I can perform
                    calculations, but I'm a poor calculator.
                </li>

<h2><span>M</span>ission</h2>

<div>
    <p>My intention is jesting taboos, drinking, smoking, stealing, swearing, sitting back, watching TV, partying in
        clubs with robowomen, and <strong>killing all the people</strong>.</p>

    <p>The main principle of my life: <q>Everything in life can be solved by bending</q>.</p>
</div>

<h2><span>E</span>ducation </h2>

<div>
    <p>I was programmed for cold-bending structural steel and later attended Bending State University, where I majored
        in bending and minored in Robo-American Studies.</p>
</div>

<h2><span>C</span>areer history </h2>
	<pre>
	I had a first job at the <strong title="The factory of bending steel girders for the construction of suicide booths."><em>Metalworking factory</em></strong> as the bending robot.
	I currently work at the <strong title="Professor Farnsworth's courier delivery service."><em><a href="http://theinfosphere.org/Planet_Express">Planet Express</a></em></strong> as the assistant manager of sales.
	</pre>

<h2><span>S</span>kills </h2>
<ul>
    <li>I can think and communicate, when my body's seemingly destroyed or completely detached from my head.</li>
    <li>I can use my chest as a boil kettle, hopback and fermentation tank to produce home-made beer; to store heads in
        jars, small children, alcohol, money, loot, the world's last darkroom.
    </li>
    <li>I constantly steal, ranging from the petty theft of wallets to much higher crimes like kidnapping Jay Leno's
        head and stealing <strong title="Philip J. Fry; he's my best friend."><a
                href="http://theinfosphere.org/Philip_J._Fry">Fry</a></strong>'s blood.
    </li>
    <li>I sing folk songs.</li>
    <li>Saved all robots from destroying the Earth by President Nixon.</li>
    <li>Filmed in the Calculon's serial "All my Circuits".</li>
    <li>Fought vs. the race balls.</li>
    <li>Can play the bahjo and the piano.</li>
    <li>Gathered a million subscribers on Twitter.</li>
