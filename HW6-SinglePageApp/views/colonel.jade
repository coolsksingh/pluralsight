p Colonel Meow was born on October 11, 2011. He was adopted in 2011 by Anne Marie Avey of Seattle, Washington, after he was rescued by a local Himalayan and Persian Society. On August 9th, 2012, Avey set up a Facebook fan page for the cat, posting pictures and videos of Colonel Meow. By September 17th, 2012, the page had 166 likes.
p On September 18th, 2012, three photos of the cat were featured on the Daily What with a link to his Facebook profile, followed by a similar post on the humor site Death and Taxes later that same day. Within 24 hours, the total count of likes for Colonel Meow’s Facebook page shot up from less than 200 to more than 9,400.
p In the following week, the photos of the fuzzy cat continued to make the rounds in the cat-friendly blogosphere and internet humor communities like The Daily Dot, Buzzfeed and Reddit. By the end of the last week in September, the Facebook page had accumulated 17,000 likes and The Daily What had featured a follow up interview with the owner Anne Marie Avey, in which she noted that Colonel Meow was scheduled to appear on the American TV talk show Ellen in December.

p Following her TV appearances in early October, Avery launched a Twitter account and Tumblr for the cat to feed the images from an Instagram account that had been established earlier in late September. Many of these photos and tweets include the hashtag #SpreadTheFrown. By October 9th, Avey claimed that the Facebook page was gaining approximately 1000 likes per day and, as of October 17th, Colonel Meow’s fan page has 78,912 likes.
