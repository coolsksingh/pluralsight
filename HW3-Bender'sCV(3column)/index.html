                <dd>I'm a high-tech robot; I was built in 2997 at Mom's Robot Factory as Bending Unit 22 (serial number
                    2716057) in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. I was created specifically for the relatively simple
                    task of bending straight metal girders to various angles.

                <dt>Design</dt>
                <dd>My design is based on an original "gas-blasting" prototype developed <strong><em>by<abbr
                        title="Professor Farnsworth. He is a crazy scientist, CEO and owner of Planet Express delivery company, professor at Mars University and my boss."><a

                </dd>
                <dd>My factory-set height is 5 ft 6 in (1.68 m); a little over 6 ft (1.8 m) with antenna.</dd>
                <dd>I have a body with a "shiny metal ass", two legs, two arms with three fingers each, a head with two
                    replaceable eyes shaped like light-emitting diodes, a mouth used for fuel intake and voice
                    communication, and a nose, but I choose not to wear it. My head has a data socket and remotely
                    operated volume control. My body has a socket for a microphone jack, a dual-socket power receptacle,
                    a reset button, a kill switch, and a self-destruct button.
                </dd>
                <dd>My head contains a 6502 Microprocessor, and my ass an Athlon II.</dd>
                <dd>Unlike other robots, I'm mortal and, according to PF's calculations, may have less than one billion
                    years to live. Because of a manufacturing error that left me without a backup unit, my memory can't
                    be transferred to another robot.

                <dd>I operate on alcohol-based fuel, which is converted into electrical energy strong enough to power
                    not only myself, but also small household appliances plugged into his power receptacle. When I stop
                    drinking and begin to sober (in human terms), I become increasingly drunk-like and dysfunctional,
                    and I grow a red beard of rust. I also have a nuclear reactor. However its location inside my body
                    and purpose aren't specified.

            Functions:
            <ul id="list_func">
                <li>My human-like character is also reinforced by my ability to display many traits like a whistling,
                    snoring, having bloodshot eyes, crying, feeling at the least physical attraction, being tickled,
                    dreaming, and belching.
                </li>
                <li>As a bending unit, I bend straight metal girders to various angles.</li>
                <li>I'm extremely durable and strong, as I'm able to break through solid objects, survive gunfire and
                    explosions, function underwater or in the vacuum of space, and sustain extremely high temperatures.
                </li>
                <li>I disassemble and reassemble my body at will and operate each detached body part individually and
                    remotely, by using my transmitter and antenna to send wireless signals.
                </li>
                <li>I use my chest cavity as a locker, which seems to store much more than is physically possible.</li>
                <li>My body's incredibly adaptive depending on the situation at hand; and I can produce needed objects
                    at will, finding them stored in my main body cavity.
                </li>
                <li>I have a computer in my head with data storage with capacity in excess of 50 TB; I can perform
                    calculations, but I'm a poor calculator.
                </li>

                </li>
                <li>I constantly steal, ranging from the petty theft of wallets to much higher crimes like kidnapping
